# The First MLflow Pipeline
This repository demonstrates how to build a simple MLflow pipeline by connecting two components.

It contains two already-built components, one that downloads the data and one that performs some data processing: it creates and visualize 
a t-SNE projection with 2 components, then saves the dataframe with the t-SNE components added as columns. 

The task is to stitch these two components together in a pipeline.
